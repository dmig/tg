## Project status

### Disclaimer

First I decided to revive abandoned [tg](https://github.com/paul-nameless/tg) project, creating this fork and merging patches from some other forks: [arza-zara](https://github.com/arza-zara/tg), [proycon](https://github.com/proycon/tg), [thirtysixpw](https://github.com/thirtysixpw/tg).
And was planning to implement some new features, like image support.

> But it turns out that underlying `ncurses` library nowhere near supports image output.
>
> Also `ncurses` is pretty buggy with emojis which are abundant in messages nowadays (possibly a character width issue).

So this makes plans to create new client from scratch, based on [notcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses) library for the UI and possibly asynchronous [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) for protocol implementation.

**I'll make some more fixes to this project and abandon it. As this is a dead end and there is no point in further development.**

### Outdated parts

I'll not do updates to these. But feel free to make pull requests.

#### Publish

`Taskfile.yml`

Needs update for the latest python version, at least.

> Run task to automatically increase version and release (<https://taskfile.dev>):
>
> ```sh
> task release
> ```

#### Github action

Same here `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

#### Docker

Using docker for such a small application is dumb. `Dockerfile` is not updated, but may still work.

## Requirements

To use tg, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Python >= 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Optional dependencies

- [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) - for Mac (used by default). You can change it to [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) for Linux or any other notifications program (see `NOTIFY_CMD` in configuration)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - to record voice msgs and upload videos.
- `xclip`/`wl-copy` from [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) for clipboard operations
- [tdlib](https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html?language=Python) - in case of incompatibility with built in package.
  For example, macOS:

  ```sh
  brew install tdlib
  ```

  and then set in config `TDLIB_PATH`
- `urlview` to choose urls when there is multiple in message, use `URL_VIEW` in config file to use another app (it should accept urls in stdin)
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger), [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) - can be used to choose file when sending, customizable with `FILE_PICKER_CMD`
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - to create groups and secret chats (used for single and multiple user selection)

## Installation

### From sources

This is the only option for my fork. [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/) is used for package management.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dmig/tg.git
cd tg
rye install python-telegram
python -m tg
```

## Configuration

Config file should be stored at `~/.config/tg/conf.py` (file name is defined in CONFIG_FILE constant). This is simple python file.

### Simple config

```python
# should start with + (plus) and contain country code
PHONE = "[phone number in international format]"
```

### Advanced configuration

All configurable variables can be found in [config.py](https://github.com/dmig/tg/blob/master/tg/config.py).
Here is an example of user config file `~/.config/tg/conf.py`:

```python
import os

# You can write anything you want here, file will be executed at start time
# You can keep you sensitive information in password managers or gpg
# encrypted files for example
def get_pass(key):
    # retrieves key from password store
    return os.popen("pass show {} | head -n 1".format(key)).read().strip()


PHONE = get_pass("i/telegram-phone")
# encrypt you local tdlib database with the key
ENC_KEY = get_pass("i/telegram-enc-key")

# log level for debugging, info by default
LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"

# If you have problems with tdlib shipped with the client, you can install and
# use your own, for example:
TDLIB_PATH = "/usr/local/Cellar/tdlib/1.6.0/lib/libtdjson.dylib"

# you can use any other notification cmd, it is simple python string which
# can format title, msg, subtitle and icon_path paramters
# In these exapmle, kitty terminal is used and when notification is pressed
# it will focus on the tab of running tg
# substituted variables:
#   sender_id, chat_id -- ids useful for grouping
#   icon_path -- chat icon path
#   title, subtitle -- app name, sender name
#   msg -- message text
NOTIFY_CMD = "/usr/local/bin/terminal-notifier -group chat-{chat_id} -title {title} -subtitle {subtitle} -message {msg} -appIcon {icon_path} -sound default -execute '/Applications/kitty.app/Contents/MacOS/kitty @ --to unix:/tmp/kitty focus-tab --no-response -m title:tg'"

# You can use your own voice recording cmd but it's better to use default one.
# The voice note must be encoded with the Opus codec, and stored inside an OGG
# container. Voice notes can have only a single audio channel.
VOICE_RECORD_CMD = "ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i ':0' -c:a libopus -b:a 32k {file_path}"

# You can customize chat and msg flags however you want.
# By default words will be used for readability, but you can make
# it as simple as one letter flags like in mutt or add emojies
CHAT_FLAGS = {
    "online": "‚óè",
    "pinned": "P",
    "muted": "M",
    # chat is marked as unread
    "unread": "U",
    # last msg haven't been seen by recipient
    "unseen": "‚úì",
    "secret": "üîí",
    "seen": "‚úì‚úì",  # leave empty if you don't want to see it
}
MSG_FLAGS = {
    "selected": "*",
    "forwarded": "F",
    "new": "N",
    "unseen": "U",
    "edited": "E",
    "pending": "...",
    "failed": "üí©",
    "seen": "‚úì‚úì",  # leave empty if you don't want to see it
}

# use this app to open url when there are multiple
URL_VIEW = 'urlview'

# Specifies range of colors to use for drawing users with
# different colors
# this one uses base 16 colors which should look good by default
USERS_COLORS = tuple(range(2, 16))

# to use 256 colors, set range appropriately
# though 233 looks better, because last colors are black and gray
# USERS_COLORS = tuple(range(233))

# to make one color for all users
# USERS_COLORS = (4,)

# cleanup cache
# Values: N days, None (never)
KEEP_MEDIA = 7

FILE_PICKER_CMD = "ranger --choosefile={file_path}"
# FILE_PICKER_CMD = "nnn -p {file_path}"
```

### Logging configuration

Would be useful for debugging.
Using `logging.conf` will override default logging configuration, so you need to do a full setup.

Example `logging.conf`:

```ini
[loggers]
keys=root,models

[handlers]
keys=fileHandler

[formatters]
keys=simpleFormatter

[logger_root]
level=INFO
handlers=fileHandler

[logger_models]
qualname=models
# silence models logger
level=WARNING
# this key is mandatory, even if empty
handlers=

[handler_fileHandler]
class=FileHandler
formatter=simpleFormatter
args=('/tmp/tg.log' ,)

[formatter_simpleFormatter]
# same format as default
format="%(levelname)s [%(asctime)s] %(filename)s:%(lineno)s - %(funcName)s | %(message)s"
```

## Keybindings
